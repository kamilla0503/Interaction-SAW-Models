**Exact Enumeration:**

* ```EE/XY_shortrange_PreviousResults``` --- previous data from short-range model study to check that my old slow python script and new c++ exact enumeration generate constent with each other results https://github.com/kamilla0503/Interaction-SAW-Models/issues/1#issuecomment-2061352704 
* ```EE/XY_Original```, ```EE/XY_OriginalRepeat``` --- results of C++ exact enumaration for short range that was used to check correctness https://github.com/kamilla0503/Interaction-SAW-Models/issues/1#issuecomment-2061352704 
* ```EE/Xy_Interaction``` --- C++ Exact Enumeration data for **Long-Interaction** used in https://github.com/kamilla0503/Interaction-SAW-Models/issues/1#issuecomment-2067213305
